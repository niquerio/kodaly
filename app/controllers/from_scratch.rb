# installed version out there somewhere.

# Add events to the track: a major scale. Arguments for note on and note off
# constructors are channel, note, velocity, and delta_time. Channel numbers
# start at zero. We use the new Sequence#note_to_delta method to get the
# delta time length of a single quarter note.

# start times, which are not written out to the MIDI file. The delta times are
